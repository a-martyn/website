## Summary

---

I'm a software engineer based in London working on applied machine learning projects using PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow. I have implemented five research papers, worked with commercial datasets, and studied ML fundamentals including linear algebra, calculus and probability theory. I have three years development experience writing Python including for production web services on AWS. I have four years experience in developing software for science and arts applications and have worked on two iPad Apps of the Year, a Webby Award winner and a BAFTA winner. 

## Software Projects

**Personal Website:** [www.alanmartyn.com](http://www.alanmartyn.com)   (for documentation, source code and posts)

**Deep Learning Paper Implementations**

- **Generative Modelling:** [Implemented the Pix2Pix GAN](https://github.com/a-martyn/pix2pix) using Keras and Tensorflow, then trained the model to produce photos of architectural facades from diagrams.
- **NLP:** [Implemented the AWD-LSTM](https://github.com/a-martyn/awd-lstm) language model using PyTorch, wrote the LSTM cell from scratch, and fixed GPU memory-leaks.
- **Vision:** [Implemented three U-net architectures](https://github.com/a-martyn/unet) for image segmentation using Keras and Tensorflow, then compared performance on the ISBI Challenge dataset.
- **Vision:** [Implemented the ResNet](https://github.com/a-martyn/resnet) convolutional architecture in PyTorch with configurable depth, then reproduced the paper's CIFAR-10 vision experiment.

**Machine Learning Projects**

- **Dataset Design:** Used web-scraping and parallel processing to build a 20,000 image dataset. Trained generative models for textile designs.
- **Vision:** Entered the [Human Protein Atlas Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification) Kaggle competition. Ranked in [the top 23%](https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification/leaderboard) of 2,200 entrants in collaboration with a team-mate.
- **Prototyping:** Competed in the South East Water, [Preventing Bursts Hackathon](https://solveitsew.devpost.com/) with a team-mate. Pre-processed a large commercial dataset, and trained a tree-based model. Ranked top-4 overall from 15+ commercial entrants.
- **Feature Engineering:** Applied feature engineering with a simple linear-regression model to the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle challenge.

**Courses**

- **Machine Learning:** Completed exercises from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). Implemented [core ML algorithms](https://github.com/a-martyn/ISL-python) in Numpy and received 5 GitHub stars to date.
- **Deep Learning:** Studied Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), and [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) courses, plus Jeremy Howard's [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) course: *Practical Deep Learning for Coders*.
- **Mathematics:** Studied Imperial College's [Mathematics for Machine Learning specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/NPDCRDLHWXCH) then lectures from Pavel Grinfeld's linear algebra courses.

**Artistic**

- Designed and engineered a 600m² sound-reactive light installation called [Helmholtz](https://www.alanmartyn.com/content/helmholtz.html). Raised crowdfunding, exhibited at the Roundhouse London and Glasgow Science Centre.
- Technical consultant for a Hollywood movie interested in transmitting images via audio.
- Wrote software to generate music based on motion data for The Mill and Absolute Vodka.
